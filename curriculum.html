    <h3>CURRICULUM</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Our schools were founded for the service of God and Humanity with unique centres of academic excellence established on the unwavering principles of strong morals and values. Children are taught by professionally trained and motivated teachers who
        share knowledge, love and tenderness. This is not only done through the four walled classes but also through learn and do programmes, excursions and educational visits. We value co-curricular activities such as band, choir, journalists, sports,
        melodies, scouting and many more. Our aim is to portray a desire to achieve.

    <p><strong> Band:</strong></p>

    <p>
        <img src="band.jpg" style="float:right;width:300px;height:150px;">The band came into fruition back in 2004 when the first blaring of the trombones was heard within the. The band has since then remained vivacious in producing the best tunes while
        expanding its wings. The Band has been invited to grace major historic events in the country such as the Karen Hospital Heart to Heart Run. This has been successful due to the efforts of its members who have vividly been intrepid and assiduous
        in playing of the instruments in all the occasions. As a band member, your child will undergo a fun, extensive and expansive training. With a wide range of aerophones some of them being trombones, trumpets, cornets, tuba, clarinets, horns, saxophones
        and drums. The members of the Band live to remember the eminent words pellucidly uttered by Visitor Hugo, "Music expresses that which cannot be said and which it is impossible to be silent." Long live our great Band.
