            <p>The Oceanic Primary was established in 1991. We are keen in prizing independent interests and emphasizing autonomy in learning. We highly emphasize on activities that value kindness, caring, empathy, and good citizenship. We focus our curricular
                and co-curricular activities on subjects that are particularly interesting to all learners. These activities attract like-minded peers, intellectual learners, artists and athletes depending on the learnersâ€™ preferences. Our trained teachers
                and staff understand each student separately; the shy, serious, introverted or sensitive temperament in learners.</p>
