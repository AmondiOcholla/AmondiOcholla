        <img src="french.jpg" style="float:right;width:300px;height:150px;"> band came into fruition back in 2004 when the first blaring of the trombones was heard within the garden. The band has since then remained vivacious in producing the best tunes
        while expanding its wings. The Garden Band has been invited to grace major historic events in the country such as the Karen Hospital Heart to Heart Run. This has been successful due to the efforts of its members who have vividly been intrepid
        and assiduous in playing of the instruments in all the occasions. As a band member, your child will undergo a fun, extensive and expansive training. With a wide range of aerophones some of them being trombones, trumpets, cornets, tuba, clarinets,
        horns, saxophones and drums. The members of the Garden Band live to remember the eminent words pellucidly uttered by Visitor Hugo, "Music expresses that which cannot be said and which it is impossible to be silent." Long live our great Garden
        Band.
